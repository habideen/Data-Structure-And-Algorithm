# Stanford University Algorithms Specialization

Learn To Think Like A Computer Scientist. Master the fundamentals of the design and analysis of algorithms.

This [directory](stanford) contains all the assignments and work taken during this course. I am open to improvement.

- Programming language: C. Only the algorithm was for some after an in-depth explanation. You may choose to use any language of your choice
- Author: [Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~768)
- Course Platform: [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)
- Specialization - [4 course series](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

## About the course

Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and the subject has countless practical applications as well as intellectual depth. This specialization is an introduction to algorithms for learners with at least a little programming experience. The specialization is rigorous but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details. After completing this specialization, you will be well-positioned to ace your technical interviews and speak fluently about algorithms with other programmers and computer scientists.

### About the instructor:

[Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~768) has been a professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University since 2004. He has taught and published extensively on the subject of algorithms and their applications.

### Applied Learning Project

Learners will practice and master the fundamentals of algorithms through several types of assessments. Every week, there is a multiple-choice quiz to test your understanding of the most important concepts. There are also weekly programming assignments, where you implement one of the algorithms covered in the lecture in a programming language of your choosing. Each course concludes with a multiple-choice final exam.

#### Below is the list of the courses in this specialization

- [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](course1)
- [Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures](course2)
